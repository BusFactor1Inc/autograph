Autograph
---------

Autograph is a CSS generation language that uses s-expressions for
styling rules and allows for the use of variables and functions
written in Common Lisp.

Autograph is written to be used with sigil, mostly because they have
the same syntax for symbol naming and transformation for class names
and ids:

          https://www.npmjs.com/package/sigil-cli

See example.ag for syntax and to see how symbol names are converted
using the Parenscript syntax:

Usage:
------

        autograph -I [include path...] style.ag > style.css

Includes;
---------

Autograph allows for the including of files as follows:

          (include "common.ag")

You can specify the include search paths with -I on the command line.
